# OSHRockets ðŸš€
An open-source part CAD library for model rocketry. All parts are welcome, just follow the standards.
If you have CAD files and are willing to write some documentation, please make a pull request and add your parts to the library. 

## Contribution Guide:
1. Parts must be flight-proven, and their usage made explicity clear
2. STEP or STL only, no proprietary formats
3. Each part file must have an accompanying .txt with identical filename
- Short description of the part
- Required fabrication techniques, Ex: FDM print, Resin print, Purchase online (provide link)
- Recommended print settings and weight (if applicable)
- Recommended usage, Ex: "Flew on ~500g 1m length rocket with Aerotech F26-6FJ"

#### Part Strength/Weight

 - For a part to be considered high strength/weight walls must be solid and at least 5mm thick. Walls cannot be skeletonized.
 - Low strength/weight parts should stay generally stay above 2mm thick and below 5mm thick. Walls can be skeletonized.
 - All separator Bulkheads should be at least 4mm thick

#### Other Dimensions
 - Fins designed for an internal fin aligner should have a 40mm long fin tab
 - All Fin tab widths should equal (in mm) (body tube outer diameter - engine tube outer diameter)/2+.2
 - Internal fin aligner slots should be 40mm tall and 3.2mm wide

# OSHRockets ðŸš€
An open-source part CAD library for model rocketry. All parts are welcome, just a few key rules:
1. Parts must be flight-proven, and their usage made explicity clear
2. STEP or STL only, no proprietary formats
3. Each part file must have an accompanying .txt with identical filename, describing the following information:
- Short description of the part
- Required fabrication techniques, Ex: FDM print, Resin print, Purchase online (provide link)
- Recommended print settings and weight (if applicable)
- Recommended usage, Ex: "Flew on ~500g 1m length rocket with Aerotech F26-6FJ"

If you have CAD files and are willing to write this little documentation, please feel free to make pull requests and add your parts to the library.
